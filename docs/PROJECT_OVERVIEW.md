```

### Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: JWT-based auth with ESPN cookie integration
2. **League Sync**: Periodic ESPN API calls to sync league/roster data
3. **Analysis Engine**: Background jobs for trade valuations and waiver analysis
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live alerts and updates
5. **Caching Layer**: Redis for API response caching and session management

## Core Components

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Dashboard**: League overview, recent activity, quick actions
- **Trade Analyzer**: Input potential trades, get AI-powered recommendations
- **Waiver Wire**: Weekly pickup/drop suggestions with priority rankings
- **Player Analytics**: Performance trends, projections, injury updates
- **Alert Center**: Customizable notifications and breaking news

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- **ESPN Integration Service**: Async API wrapper with retry logic and rate limiting
- **Trade Evaluation Engine**: Multi-factor analysis including player values, positional needs, schedule strength
- **Waiver Wire Analyzer**: Target identification based on availability, upside, and team needs
- **Alert System**: Injury monitoring, breakout detection, and opportunity identification
- **User Management**: Authentication, preferences, league associations

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
- **Users**: Authentication and preferences
- **Leagues**: ESPN league metadata and settings  
- **Teams**: User rosters and lineups
- **Players**: ESPN player data with enhanced analytics
- **Transactions**: Trade and waiver history for learning
- **Alerts**: User notification preferences and history

## Development Phases

- [x] Project setup and infrastructure
- [ ] ESPN API integration with authentication
- [ ] Basic league and roster data sync
- [ ] User authentication and league association
- [ ] Simple dashboard with league overview

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Trade suggestion engine with basic valuations
- [ ] Waiver wire analysis and recommendations
- [ ] Player performance tracking and trends
- [ ] Basic alert system for injuries and news

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- [ ] Advanced trade evaluation with machine learning
- [ ] Predictive waiver wire targets
- [ ] Automated lineup optimization
- [ ] Custom alert rules and smart notifications

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-league management
- [ ] League comparison and benchmarking
- [ ] Historical performance analysis
- [ ] Mobile app companion
- [ ] Social features and league chat integration

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily active users during fantasy season
- Average session duration
- Feature adoption rates (trade tool, waiver assistant)

### Performance Impact
- User win rate improvement vs. baseline
- Trade acceptance rate for suggestions
- Successful waiver wire pickups from recommendations

### Technical Metrics
- API response times < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime during peak fantasy hours
- Real-time alert delivery < 5 seconds
- ESPN API rate limit compliance

## Technical Considerations

### Scalability
- Async-first architecture for handling multiple ESPN API calls
- Database indexing strategy for player lookups and analytics
- Caching layer for frequently accessed ESPN data
- Horizontal scaling preparation for multiple leagues/users

### Security
- Secure ESPN cookie handling and storage
- JWT token management with refresh logic
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Reliability
- Graceful ESPN API failure handling
- Database connection pooling and retry logic
- Background job monitoring and failure recovery
- Comprehensive logging and error tracking

## ESPN API Integration Strategy

### Authentication Flow
1. User provides ESPN league URL or ID
2. For private leagues, user provides S2 and SWID cookies
3. Validate access and store encrypted credentials
4. Establish periodic sync schedule

### Data Synchronization
- **Real-time**: Player news, injury updates, game scores
- **Daily**: Roster changes, waiver claims, trades
- **Weekly**: Matchup data, playoff scenarios
- **Seasonal**: Draft results, season statistics

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Maximum 60 requests per minute per league
- Intelligent batching for bulk data requests
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Fallback to cached data during API outages

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with other fantasy platforms (Yahoo, Sleeper)
- Advanced machine learning for player projections
- Commissioner tools for league management
- API for third-party integrations
- Mobile notifications and widget support
